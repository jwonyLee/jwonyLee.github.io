Hi, Matt!

I expect the new school year.Â I will improve my English skill as you said.

To learn English, I will read programming posts written in English. and I will write a blog post about my programming experience.

Already, I wrote a post on the topic that is my programming history.
Every day, I will study at Duolingo that is learning Languages with quizzes. And I will try to speaking English with you. 

well, see you later.
