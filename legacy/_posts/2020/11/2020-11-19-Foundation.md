> The Foundation framework provides a base layer of functionality for apps and frameworks, including data storage and persistence, text processing, date and time calculations, sorting and filtering, and networking. The classes, protocols, and data types defined by Foundation are used throughout the macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS SDKs.

> Foundation 프레임워크는 데이터 저장 및 지속성, 텍스트 처리, 날짜 및 시간 계산, 정렬 및 필터링, 네트워킹을 포함하여 앱 및 프레임워크에 대한 기본 기능 계층을 제공한다. Foundation에서 정의한 클래스, 프로토콜 및 데이터 유형은 macOS, iOS, watchOS 및 tvOS SDK 전체에서 사용된다.
