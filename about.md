I'm preparing for iOS Engineer. 
This blog is for documentation about my programming experience, etc. Almost written by Korean.

- I'm not scared of learning new things, rather I like it! I make whatever needs it iOS Apps, Website, Android Apps, Shell Script, etc.
- I like reading, writing.
- I try to write clean code. (I know that the definition of clean code is ambiguous.) Anyway, To do that, I try to lot of reading codes written by someone else.
- I'm also interested in Open Source, and then contributed to [ochococo/OOD-Principles-In-Swift](https://github.com/ochococo/OOD-Principles-In-Swift) by translating Korean.
- Besides, I'm interested in productivity tools, architecture, design patterns, etc.
- As written in the blog main, Currently interesting in building my own writing system and learning English.
